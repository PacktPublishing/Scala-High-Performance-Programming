Scala is an audacious programming language that blends object-oriented and functional programming concepts on the JVM.
You should install Java Development Kit version 8 or higher for your operating system to work through all code examples. This book discusses the Oracle HotSpot JVM, and it demonstrates tools that are included in Oracle JDK. You should also get the latest version of [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) (version 0.13.11, at the time of writing).
